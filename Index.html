        <h2>Brief Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>The first thing that I did once the brief was
            released was break it down using decomposition.
            This made approaching each aspect easier and made sure
            that every element of the project would be covered and
            not forgotten about. This is the beginning stage of any
            design loop - defining the problem. Here are the two parts
            of the brief:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>
            For this project you are required to design and develop:<br>
            1. An interactive website on behalf of a fictional home
            automation company.<br>
            2. An embedded system that could be used as part of a
            home automation system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            All of these are required to score higher than a H4 (with advanced
            requirements):<br>
            <b>Website:</b><br>
            - Suits fictional smart home company<br>
            - 4 pages including a home page<br>
            - User-friendly navigation with clean visual design<br>
            - Use of: Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Tables, Links, Images, Multimedia<br>
            - Is accessible (Mobile devices etc.)<br>
            <b>Embedded System:</b><br>
            - Standalone Device<br>
            - Should work with minimal user input
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The main difference here is the inclusion of control
            or monitoring of the embedded system from the website or
            another networked device. This means that data must go from
            website to system or vice versa.<br>
            Another difference is the inclusion of more data capture within
            the website (forms, labels, buttons, menus, etc.)<br>
            As well as these there should be the implementation of a
            validation system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Choosing a Problem</h3>
        <p>My first task in beginning this project was deciding upon the theme
            and function of my smart home device. For this, I made a spider
            diagram of my ideas along with friends and family in a variety of
            different demographics I interviewed on the subject.I first found
            the common problem in the household and then came up with computational
            solutions to the problem.
        </p>
        <img src="/Imgs/spiderDiagram.JPG" style="width: 500px;">
        <h3>3 Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            After researching some common household problems, I then came up with
            three different solutions that would fit the brief.<br>
            My first was a typical smart home feature that allowed the user to
            control lights from their browser. This solution had advanced options
            such as light timing or control using sensors.<br>
            My second solution was an automated pet feeder. This could use a
            servo motor to open and close a valve of pet food. This feeder could be
            automated or manually controlled through a website.<br>
            My third idea was a basic smart home device catered towards elderly people
            or those distrustful of always-listening devices. When started, the system
            records what the user is saying and then sends that to a webpage allowing
            the user to view their reminders or notes.
        </p>
        <h3>Chosen Solution</h3>
        <p>
            I evaluated my three solutions and rated them based on: the time required, how
            well they fit the brief, my interest in the subject and difficulty. Through this,
            I came to the conclusion that I would do my third solution. This is the smart
            reminder device. One of the reasons for this was the challenge of using an AI system
            which I had never done before. I also thought that this was the most practical
            of the solutions and the most likely to be useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Decomposition of Solution</h3>
        <p>
            I break down the project into more manageable chunks to make doing the project
            easier. This also aided in my research. They were:<br>
            - Recording Voice<br>
            - Audio to Text<br>
            - Sending Data to Database<br>
            - Viewing the Data<br>
            - Company Website
        </p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <img src="Imgs/brainstorm.jpg" style="width: 400px;">
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2 id="Design">Design</h2>
        <h3>Recording Voice</h3>
        <p>
            This is the embedded system portion of the project
            This would be performed locally on the raspberry pi. It will
            record a snippet of audio and save it to the system so it can then
            be converted into text format.<br>
            After researching this topic, I decided to use python along with
            a small usb microphone plugged into the raspberry pi. I considered other
            single board computers for this project but the raspberry pi seemed the most
            appropriate and had the most ressources surrounding it online.<br>
            For the recording process itself I decided I would use a software called
            Alsa. I chose this because it was built into the Pi's linux os and was
            highly recommended by others I had found doing similar things online.<br>
            Too work with this audio in python I chose the python import PyAudio.
            This was because of it's ease of use and I had found a lot of resources online
            to help use it.

        <h3>Audio to Text</h3>
        <p>
            This portion of the project uses AI techology to convert a audio
            file into text format. Unfortunately I don't have the skills nor time
            to create this type of programme so I decided to use an import to help
            me achieve this.<br>
            I looked into different methods of achieving this text to speech system. I 
            needed it to be a quick and reliable process. I learned about a python import 
            called speech_recognition. This import gave me lots of audio to text AI solutions 
            to choose from made by companies such as Bing and Google. 
        </p>
        <h3>Sending Data to Database</h3>
        <p>
            This part involves getting the text file recorded and sending it
            to some kind of database so that it can be later accesed by the
            website.<br>
            I looked into different databases and different ways in which I could
            access this database. This part of the project brought the most difficulty 
            as can be seen from the actual design. The databases I looked into were ThinkSpeak,
            Amazon Web Services and Firebase. Firebase was my original choice and what I eventually came
            back to. I also looked at other languages to achieve this such as Python and Sql but settled
            on using Python.
        </p>
        <h3>Viewing the Data</h3>
        <p>
            For the user to be able to view the data I need to have a way in which
            I can first get the text data from the database to the website.<br>
            For this part of the research, I designed my solution along with my solution
            to sending the data. This was because they were both reliant on each other. 
            I trialed the same databases as the ones I used to send the data. I decided
            to use Javascript as the language to recieve the data and display it in a 
            HTML element.
        </p>
        <h3>Company Website</h3>
        <p>
            For this section I need to create a website with at least 4 web pages,
            a data capture feature and to display my data from my database.<br>
            I had worked with websites before as a part of my ALTs but for this project I 
            wanted my website to reflect the qualities of proffesional websites used by 
            tech corperations. I made a list of websites that I thought displayed these 
            qualities and began learning how I could create the same look myself.<br>
            I did research focused on the use of Javascript, CSS animations and layering 
            HTML elements. These parts of the website I think bring it closer to one which
            is used by smart home companiess.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>In this project I used the iterative design process seen in this diagram.
            This process is one that I have focused on throughout this project and
            previous ALTs. I first created a planning document, seen in the previous 
            section. I also kept a GANTT diagram there to keep me on trackw with the 
            project deadline. I used pseudo code to help in creating the Pythone code 
            for the embedded system. Before creating my website, I made wireframe sketches. 
            This greatly sped up the website development process. When I thought I was 
            finished with my website I got feedback from classmates and friends to get 
            an outside perspective. Once I was happy with the feedback, I evaluated the
            project myself.
        </p>
        <h3>Pseudo Code</h3>
        <p>I used pseudo code when making the Python script for my embedded system.
            This made the process a lot simpler by using computational thinking to 
            approach each problem individually. This use of abstraction meant I could
            focus on the main points for each step of the project<br>
            My pseudo code went as follows:<br>
            - Import modules for audio, speach recognition and firebase.<br>
            - Define all variables for audio.<br>
            - Loop through recording function.<br>
            - Save audio as a .wav file.<br>
            - Use speech recognition to convert .wav file to text file<br>
            - Send text data to firebase<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Audio Development</h3>
        <p>My first step in setting up the audio on the pi was configuring the microphone
            so that it was recognised by the system. To do this I needed to use a linux driver
            called Alsa. Using this driver in the linux terminal, I could view my device number
            and then set it as the default microphone for the system. I then ran a test recording
            which was succesful. This was my first time working in the linux terminal and it was
            a good learning experience for me.<br>
            With my microphone set up and device number I could begin working with the microphone
            in python. I used the PyAudio import and using their documentation I specified each
            variable required to record. These were sample rate, chunks and recording time. I then
            ran their audio function and looped it for the required time. This code was difficult 
            but I found lots of good documentation online to help.<br>
            I then set up my firebase database so that I could save these text files. This came with 
            problems at first as the raspberry pi did not include the imports that the firebase import
            required. After a lot of searching I found somebody else with the same problem as me on 
            Stack Overflow. They had found 5 imports for Python that firebase requires to function.
            After installing these imports I was able to get firebase to run normally on the system.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Development</h3>
        <p>
            After I had set up my embedded system, I started to focus on my website. Before making 
            the web pages and making the site look good, I decided to first get the recieval of data 
            portion functioning. I knew this would be a challenge as in my previous experience in the 
            class, this was very difficult. The main reason for this is because Firebase is constantly 
            updated. This means that a tutorial that was accurate a few months ago might not work now.
            Even the examples that come from the department no longer work currently!<br>
            Luckily after a lot of trial and error, I was able to find a tutorial that helped me 
            to create a javascript porgramme that could recieve the data from the database and display
            it as a HTML element.<br>
            Once this was completed I moved onto the rest of the website. I started off with the 
            scaffoling of the website using HTML. once this was done I formatted the website to make it
            look good using CSS. I wanted the website to have a distinct topbar and sidebar which is 
            a common feature in proffesionally used websites. To this I learned about Z-Index and box shadows.<br>
            I also wanted the website to be dynamic. One of the ways I achieved this was by learning about
            CSS animations. These animations were implemented in my burger menu at the top left which transforms
            into an x when clicked, my moving sidebar and the slow display dimming when the sidebar is opened.
            I think these features make a huge impact on the overall quality of the website.<br>
            It also featured a lot of Javascript, something I learned a lot about during the project. 
            I used it to change CSS atributes when the menu button was clicked, for the data recieval 
            from the database and for my login screen which gets a data capture from the user in the form 
            of a username and password. The Javascript function confirms if they are correct, alerts the user if so 
            and changes the displayed web page.<br>
            User Experience was something I took into consideration while building the site.
            I used complementary colours using a colour generator to make the website easy on the eyes.
            I also use legible font which I picked from a recommended sample for web design.
        </p>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>Testing plays a huge role in the development of code and this has become clear to 
            me during the projects I have done. In each of the parts of the project I was testing 
            at every step along the way. This can be seen with the audio section where I tested
            my microphone or with the databases where I set up test databases to verify whether my
            code would work. The testing on the python programmes and the website are examples of
            white box testing whereas the testing done on the audio software and the databases are known
            as black box testing. Both of these were integral in completing this project.
        </p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Throughout my development I used Github repositories to store and organize
            my different programmes. This gave me a speed advantage with my overall development.
            Working with Gihub is also a important skill which will be helpful for me 
            in the future.
