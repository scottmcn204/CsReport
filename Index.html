        <h2>Brief Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>The first thing that i did once the brief was 
            released was breaking it down using decomposition.
            This made approaching each aspect easier and made sure 
            that every element of the project would be covered and
            not forgotten about. This is the begining stage of any
            design loop - defining the problem. Here is the two parts
            of the brief:
        </p>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>
            For this project you are required to design and develop:<br>
            1. An interactive website on behalf of a fictional home 
            automation company.<br>
            2. An embedded system that could be used as part of a 
            home automation system.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            All of these are required to score higher than a H4 (with advanced
            requirements):<br>
            <b>Website:</b><br>
            - Suits fictional smart home company<br>
            - 4 Pages including home page<br>
            - User friendly navigation with clean visual design<br>
            - Use of: Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Tables, Links, Images, Multimedia<br>
            - Is accessible (Mobile devices etc.)<br>
            <b>Embedded System:</b><br>
            - Standalone Device<br>
            - Should work with minimal user input
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The Main difference here is the inclusion of control
            or monitering of the embedded system form the website or
            another networked device. This means that data must go from 
            website to system or vice versa.<br>
            Another difference is the inclusion of more data capture within
            the website (forms, labels, buttons, menus, etc.)<br>
            As well as these there should be the implementation of a
            validation system.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Choosing a Problem</h3>
        <p>My first task in begining this project was deciding upon the theme
            and function of my smart home device. For this I made a spider
            diagram of my ideas along with friends and family in a variety of
            different demographics I interviewed  on the subject. First finding 
            the common problem in the household and then coming up with computational 
            solutions to the problem.

        <h3>3 Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            After researching some common household problems, I then came up with 
            three different solutions that would fit the brief.<br> 
            My first was a typical smart home feature which allowed the user to 
            control lights from their browser. This solution had advanced options
            such as light timing or control using sensors.<br>
            My second solution was an automated pet feeder. This could could use a 
            servo motor to open and close a valve of pet food. This feeder could be 
            automated or manually controlled through a website.<br>
            My third idea was a basic
