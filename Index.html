        <h2>Investigation and Plan</h2>
        <h2>Brief Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>The first thing that i did once the brief was 
            released was breaking it down using decomposition.
            This made approaching each aspect easier and made sure 
            that every element of the project would be covered and
            not forgotten about. This is the begining stage of any
            design loop - defining the problem. Here is the two parts
            of the brief:
        </p>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>
            For this project you are required to design and develop:<br>
            1. An interactive website on behalf of a fictional home 
            automation company.<br>
            2. An embedded system that could be used as part of a 
            home automation system.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            All of these are required to score higher than a H4 (with advanced
            requirements):<br>
            <b>Website:</b><br>
            - Suits fictional smart home company<br>
            - 4 Pages including home page<br>
            - User friendly navigation with clean visual design<br>
            - Use of: Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Tables, Links, Images, Multimedia<br>
            - Is accessible (Mobile devices etc.)<br>
            <b>Embedded System:</b><br>
            - Standalone Device<br>
            - Should work with minimal user input
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The Main difference here is the inclusion of control
            or monitering of the embedded system form the website or
            another networked device. This means that data must go from 
            website to system or vice versa.<br>
            Another difference is the inclusion of more data capture within
            the website (forms, labels, buttons, menus, etc.)<br>
            As well as these there should be the implementation of a
            validation system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Choosing a Problem</h3>
        <p>My first task in begining this project was deciding upon the theme
            and function of my smart home device. For this I made a spider
            diagram of my ideas along with friends and family in a variety of
            different demographics I interviewed  on the subject. First finding 
            the common problem in the household and then coming up with computational 
            solutions to the problem.
        </p>
        <img src="/Imgs/spiderDiagram.JPG" style="width: 500px;">
        <h3>3 Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            After researching some common household problems, I then came up with 
            three different solutions that would fit the brief.<br> 
            My first was a typical smart home feature which allowed the user to 
            control lights from their browser. This solution had advanced options
            such as light timing or control using sensors.<br>
            My second solution was an automated pet feeder. This could could use a 
            servo motor to open and close a valve of pet food. This feeder could be 
            automated or manually controlled through a website.<br>
            My third idea was a basic smart home device catered towards elderly people
            or those distrustful of always listening devices. When started, the system 
            records what the user is saying and then sends that to a webpage allowing
            the user to view their reminders or notes. 
        </p>
        <h3>Chosen Solution</h3>
        <p>
            I evaluated my three solutions and rated them based on: time required, how
            well they fit the brief, my interest in the subject and difficulty. Through this 
            I came to the conclusion that I would do my third solution. This is the smart 
            reminder device. One of the reasons for this was the challenge of using an AI system
            which I had never done before. I also thought that this was the most practical
            of the solutions and the most likely to be useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Decomposition of Solution</h3>
        <p>
            I break down the project into more managable chunks to make doing the project 
            easier. This also aided in my research. They were:<br>
            - Recording Voice<br>
            - Audio to Text<br>
            - Sending Data to Database<br>
            - Viewing the Data<br>
            - Company Website
        </p>
        <h3>Pseudocode/Overview</h3>
        <img src="Imgs/brainstorm.jpg" style="width: 400px;">
        <h3>Recording Voice</h3>
        <p>
            This is the embedded system portion of the project
            This would be performed locally on the raspberry pi. It will
            record a snippet of audio and save it to the system so it can then
            be converted into text format.<br>
            After researching this topic, I decided to use python along with 
            a small usb microphone plugged into the raspberry pi.
        <h3>Audio to Text</h3>
        <p>
            This portion of the project uses AI techology to convert a audio 
            file into text format. Unfortunately I don't have the skills nor time 
            to create this type of programme so I decided to use an import to help
            me achieve this. 
        </p>
        <h3>Sending Data to Database</h3>
        <p>
            This part involves getting the text file recorded and sending it 
            to some kind of database so that it can be later accesed by the 
            website.<br>
            I looked into different databases and different ways in which I could
            access this database.
        </p>
        <h3>Viewing the Data</h3>
        <p>
            For the user to be able to view the data I need to have a way in which 
            I can 
        </p>
        <h3>Company Website</h3>
