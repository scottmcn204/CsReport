        <h2>Brief Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="bubble2">
            <h3>Decomposition</h3>
            <img src="Imgs/designPro.png" style="width:150px; float:right;"><br>
            <p class="img">
                The first thing that I did once the brief was
                released was breaking it down using <b>decomposition</b>.
                This made approaching each aspect easier and made sure
                that every element of the project would be covered and
                not forgotten about. This is the beginning stage of any
                <b>design loop</b> - defining the problem. Here are the two parts
                of the brief:<br>
                
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
                For this project you are required to design and develop:<br>
                1. An interactive website on behalf of a fictional home
                automation company.<br>
                2. An embedded system that could be used as part of a
                home automation system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                All of these are required to score higher than a H4 (with advanced
                requirements):<br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                - Suits fictional smart home company<br>
                - 4 pages including a home page<br>
                - User-friendly navigation with clean visual design<br>
                - Use of: Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Tables, Links, Images, Multimedia<br>
                - Is accessible (Mobile devices etc.)<br>
                <b>Embedded System:</b><br>
                - Standalone Device<br>
                - Should work with minimal user input
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Advanced Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                The main difference here is the inclusion of control
                or monitoring of the embedded system from the website or
                another networked device. This means that data must go from
                website to system or vice versa.<br>
                Another difference is the inclusion of more data capture within
                the website (forms, labels, buttons, menus, etc.)<br>
                As well as these there should be the implementation of a
                validation system.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <div class="bubble2">
            <h3>Choosing a Problem</h3>
            <img src="Imgs/spiderDiagram.JPG" style="width: 350px; float: right;">
            <p>My first task in beginning this project was deciding upon the theme
                and function of my smart home device. For this, I made a <b>spider
                    diagram</b> of my ideas along with friends and family in a variety of
                <b>different demographics</b> I interviewed on the subject. I first found
                the common problem in the household and then came up with <b>computational
                    solutions</b> to the problem. I also looked into some existing solutions 
                    to household problems. This was helpful in coming up with my solutions.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>3 Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                After researching some common household problems, I then came up with
                three different solutions that would fit the brief.<br>
                My first was a typical smart home feature that allowed the user to
                control lights from their browser. This solution had advanced options
                such as light timing or control using sensors.<br>
                My second solution was an automated pet feeder. This could use a
                servo motor to open and close a valve of pet food. This feeder could be
                automated or manually controlled through a website.<br>
                My third idea was a basic smart home device catered towards elderly people
                or those distrustful of always-listening devices. When started, the system
                records what the user is saying and then sends that to a webpage allowing
                the user to view their reminders or notes.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Chosen Solution</h3>
            <p>
                I evaluated my three solutions and rated them based on: the time required, how
                well they fit the brief, my interest in the subject and difficulty. Through this,
                I came to the conclusion that I would do my third solution. This is the smart
                reminder device. One of the reasons for this was the challenge of using an AI system
                which I had never done before. I also thought that this was the most <b>practical</b>
                of the solutions and the most likely to be <b>useful</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Decomposition of Solution</h3>
            <p>
                I broke down the project into more manageable chunks to make doing the project
                easier. This also aided in my research. They were:<br>
                - Recording Voice<br>
                - Audio to Text<br>
                - Sending Data to Database<br>
                - Viewing the Data<br>
                - Company Website
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div class="bubble2">
            <h3>Recording Voice</h3>
            <p>
                This is the <b>embedded system</b> portion of the project
                This would be performed locally on the raspberry pi. It will
                record a snippet of audio and save it to the system so it can then
                be converted into text format.<br>
                After researching this topic, I decided to use python along with
                a small usb microphone plugged into the raspberry pi. I considered other
                single board computers for this project but the raspberry pi seemed the most
                appropriate and had the most resources surrounding it online.<br>
                For the recording process itself I decided I would use a software called
                Alsa. I chose this because it was built into the Pi's linux os and was
                highly recommended by others I had found doing similar things online.<br>
                To work with this audio in python I chose the python import PyAudio.
                This was because of it's ease of use and I had found a lot of resources online
                to help use it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Audio to Text</h3>
            <p>
                This portion of the project uses <b>AI technology</b> to convert an audio
                file into text format. Unfortunately I don't have the skills nor time
                to create this type of programme so I decided to use an import to help
                me achieve this.<br>
                I looked into different methods of achieving this text to speech system. I 
                needed it to be a quick and reliable process. I learned about a python import 
                called <b>speech_recognition</b>. This import gave me lots of audio to text AI solutions 
                to choose from made by companies such as Bing and Google. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sending Data to Database</h3>
            <p>
                This part involves getting the text file recorded and sending it
                to a <b>database</b> so that it can be later accessed by the
                website.<br>
                I looked into different databases and different ways in which I could
                access this database. This part of the project brought the most difficulty 
                as can be seen from the actual design. The databases I looked into were ThinkSpeak,
                Amazon Web Services and Firebase. Firebase was my original choice and what I eventually came
                back to. I also looked at other languages to achieve this such as Python and Sql but settled
                on using Python.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Viewing the Data</h3>
            <p>
                For the user to be able to view the data I need to have a way in which
                I can first get the text data from the database to the website.<br>
                For this part of the research, I designed my solution along with my solution
                to sending the data. This was because they were both reliant on each other. 
                I trialled the same databases like the ones I used to send the data. I decided
                to use Javascript as the language to receive the data and display it in an 
                HTML element.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Company Website</h3>
            <p>
                For this section I need to create a website with at least 4 web pages,
                a data capture feature and to display my data from my database.<br>
                I had worked with websites before as a part of my ALTs but for this project I 
                wanted my website to reflect the qualities of professional websites used by 
                tech corporations. I made a list of websites that I thought displayed these 
                qualities and began learning how I could create the same look myself.<br>
                I did research focused on the use of Javascript, CSS animations and layering 
                HTML elements. These parts of the website I think bring it closer to one which
                is used by smart home companies.

            <img src="Imgs/GANTT.jpeg" style="width:400px; float:left;">
            <img src="Imgs/designPro.png" style="width:200px; float: right;"><br>
            <p>In this project I used the iterative design process seen in this diagram.
                This process is one that I have focused on throughout this project and
                previous ALTs. I first created a planning document, seen in the previous 
                section. I also kept a GANTT diagram there to keep me on track with the 
                project deadline. I used pseudo code to help in creating the Python code 
                for the embedded system. Before creating my website, I made wireframe sketches. 
                This greatly sped up the website development process. When I thought I was 
                finished with my website I got feedback from classmates and friends to get 
                an outside perspective. Once I was happy with the feedback, I evaluated the
                project myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Pseudo Code</h3>
            <p>I used pseudo code when making the Python script for my embedded system.
                This made the process a lot simpler by using computational thinking to 
                approach each problem individually. This use of abstraction meant I could
                focus on the main points for each step of the project<br>
                My pseudo code went as follows:<br>
                - Import modules for audio, speech recognition and firebase.<br>
                - Define all variables for audio.<br>
                - Loop through recording function.<br>
                - Save audio as a .wav file.<br>
                - Use speech recognition to convert .wav file to text file<br>
                - Send text data to firebase<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Audio Development</h3>
            
            <p>
                <img src="Imgs/linuxMic.png" style="width:500px;float: left;"><br>
                My first step in setting up the audio on the pi was configuring the microphone
                so that it was recognised by the system. To do this I needed to use a linux driver
                called Alsa. Using this driver in the linux terminal, I could view my device number
                and then set it as the default microphone for the system. I then ran a test recording
                which was successful. This was my first time working in the linux terminal and it was
                a good learning experience for me.<br><br><br>
            <img src="Imgs/PyAudio.png" style="width:500px;float:left">
                With my microphone set up and device number I could begin working with the microphone
                in python. I used the PyAudio import and using their documentation I specified each
                variable required to record. These were sample rate, chunks and recording time. I then
                ran their audio function and looped it for the required time. This code was difficult 
                but I found lots of good documentation online to help.<br>
                <br><br>
                I then set up my firebase database so that I could save these text files. This came with 
                problems at first as the raspberry pi did not include the imports that the firebase import
                required. After a lot of searching I found somebody else with the same problem as me on 
                Stack Overflow. They had found 5 imports for Python that firebase requires to function.
                After installing these imports I was able to get firebase to run normally on the system.<br>

            <h3>Website Development</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Imgs/Fetch.png" style="width:500px; float:left"><br><br>
                After I had set up my embedded system, I started to focus on my website. Before making 
                the web pages and making the site look good, I decided to first get the retrieval of data 
                portion functioning. I knew this would be a challenge as in my previous experience in the 
                class, this was very difficult. The main reason for this is because Firebase is constantly 
                updated. This means that a tutorial that was accurate a few months ago might not work now.
                Even the examples that come from the department no longer work currently!<br>
                Luckily after a lot of trial and error, I was able to find a tutorial that helped me 
                to create a javascript programme that could receive the data from the database and display
                it as a HTML element. This was achieved through shared learning between me and some other 
                students in my class with the same problem.<br>
                <br><br>
                Once this was completed I moved onto the rest of the website. I started off with the 
                scaffolding of the website using HTML.<br>
                <img src="Imgs/webMenu.png" style="width:400px"><br><br>
                <img src="Imgs/CssGeneral.png" style="width:300px; float:right"><br><br>
                Once this was done I formatted the website to make it
                look good using CSS. I wanted the website to have a distinct topbar and sidebar which is 
                a common feature in profesionally used websites. To do this I learned about Z-Index and box shadows.<br><br><br>
                
                I also wanted the website to be dynamic. One of the ways I achieved this was by learning about
                CSS animations. These animations were implemented in my burger menu at the top left which transforms
                into an x when clicked, my moving sidebar and the slow display dimming when the sidebar is opened.
                I think these features make a huge impact on the overall quality of the website.<br>

                It also featured a lot of Javascript, something I learned a lot about during the project. 
                I used it to change CSS attributes when the menu button was clicked, for the data receival 
                from the database and for my login screen which gets a data capture from the user in the form 
                of a username and password. The Javascript function confirms if they are correct, alerts the user if so 
                and changes the displayed web page. I had a problem with this part of the project, but got a solution 
                from a StackOverflow user.<br>

                User Experience was something I took into consideration while building the site.
                I used complementary colours using a colour generator to make the website easy on the eyes.
                I also use legible font which I picked from a recommended sample for web design.<br>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p><img src="Imgs/agileTesting.jpg" style="width:300px; float:right;"><br><br>
                Testing plays a huge role in the development of code and this has become clear to 
                me during the projects I have done. In each of the parts of the project I was testing 
                at every step along the way. This can be seen with the audio section where I tested
                my microphone or with the databases where I set up test databases to verify whether my
                code would work. The testing on the python programmes and the website are examples of
                white box testing whereas the testing done on the audio software and the databases are known
                as black box testing. Both of these were integral in completing this project.<br>
                I also followed an agile testing methodology which is incremental meaning software was 
                continuously tested as I worked.

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Throughout my development I used Github repositories to store and organize
                my different programmes. This gave me a speed advantage with my overall development.
                Working with Github is also a important skill that will be helpful for me 
                in the future.<br>

            <p>
                <b>Basic Requirements:</b><br>
                - My website suits one used by a smart home company<br>
                - My website includes 4 pages including it's home page<br>
                - I believe that my website has a user friendly design which is clean visually<br>
                - I used a variety of different HTML elements seen in the brief<br>
                - My website is accessible and responsive<br>
                <b>Advanced Requirements:</b><br>
                - My embedded system can be monitored and controlled from this websites<br>
                - Data capture is used, specifically in my log in verification, buttons and menus<br>
                - There is a validation system present which authenticates the user before displaying data<br>

            <h3>Final  Website Design</h3>
            <p>
                I am very happy with how my final website design turned out for this project.
                I achieved my goal of creating a website that could fit the purpose of being used
                by a smart home company with some more advanced features which I was able to learn
                more about such as CSS animation and Javascript. I really enjoyed learning about 
                these features and hope to implement them in more websites in the future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Final System Design</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that my design for the artefact that I have made meets the requirements 
                of the end user completely. Throughout my design I consulted many potential end user 
                demographics as to improve the usability of both the embedded system and the website. 
                This includes consistent design in the website and easy to understand automation within 
                the embedded system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Further Modifications and Studies</h3>
            <p>
                Given more time to work on the project I would first improve my implementation of 
                the embedded system. While my current design is functional, with more time I could 
                give the user more options with the data on the website such as edit or delete. I could 
                also include more information such as time, date and location of voice note. In terms of the 
                website I could do more research into different design ideologies to make the website more eye 
                catching and have a natural flow. Another area I would like to look into further in the future 
                is the use of Javascript in web development. When researching I looked into some 3d graphics libraries
                such as three.js. Unfortunately, this was not appropriate for this project but I would like to learn 
                more about this in the future.

            <h3>W3Schools</h3>
            <p>
                W3Schools was an important resource for me throughout this project. This is 
                especially true for the implementation of my website. I was able to use it to aid 
                myself in finding small syntax errors and teach myself all of the required tools 
                to make my own unique website without needing to copy and paste from others.

            <br>
            <h3>StackOverflow</h3>
            <p>
                StackOverflow was a very helpful resource in this project. I was able to use its search 
                feature to debug specific problems I was having in my code. I did this when figuring out which 
                Python libraries I would need on the Raspberry Pi. I also used the PRIMM methodology when 
                looking at other peoples sample code on StackOverflow. I also created a post on StackOverflow 
                when I had a specific issue in creating my log in validation code in Javascript. Fortunately,
                I got some comments that pointed me in the right direction and I was able to fix the issue.
